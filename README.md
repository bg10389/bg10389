# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben â€“ Multiâ€‘Disciplinary Mechatronics Engineer & Maker

Iâ€™m a junior Mechatronics Engineering student at Kennesaw State University, President & Mechanical Lead of the KSU Electric Vehicle Team, and an inventor who loves turning unusual ideas into working prototypes. My specialty: A broad skillset spanning hardware, software, manufacturing, and research, so I can tackle every phase of development, from concept to execution. I have a vast experience in numerous fields with a very early start in STEM, and the intuition gained from over a decade (Yes, really!) of experience.

##  How do I have this much experience?

I've always been fascinated with building things, electronics, and the combination of those two for as long as i can remember. Working on perfboards and diy kits from radioshack when i was in middle school, I learned as much as I physically could and did as much as I could even up until today. I have a passion and drive to make things and innovate, and it has fueled me for my entire life.
